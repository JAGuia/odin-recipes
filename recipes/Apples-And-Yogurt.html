        <!--Brief Introduction-->
        <h3> Origin of Apples</h3>
        <p> Apples had existed on earth since the dawn of time. They had always lived
            in the trees, untouched for centuries. However, it wasn't until one fell on the head 
            of Isaac Newton that they were discovered! <i>or was that gravity... I forget.</i>
